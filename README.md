This is a list of players who have been flagged for suspicious activity in the online version of Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA 5 Online). Some of the players on this list have been manually added after they were observed engaging in disruptive behavior, such as killing all other players or causing explosions, which can only be caused by using a mod menu. This list is updated daily. To Rockstar administrators who may view this list, we suggest that you keep a close eye on these players, especially those who have triggered crash detections.

#detections

Sound Spam: repeated playing of loud or disruptive sounds that can only be executed with a mod menu.
Karen: Kicked another player via a mod menu.
Player Godmode: Player was unable to be damaged. Player was not in an interior - plus a few additional checks.
Session Mismatch: Triggered when a modder spoofs what session he is in. Only a modder can trigger this.
RAC: Triggered Rockstars Anti Cheat. They may or may not be cheating.
Frame Flags: The player has modified flags on their character - making them invincible to fire, explosions, bullets, etc. Basically a more advanced god mode. Only a modder can trigger Frame Flags.
Invalid Object: A player spawns an object that is invalid and should not be spawned.
IP Spoof: Player has spoofed their IP Address.
Vehicle Godmode: The player's vehicle can not be damaged.
Altered Host Token: A player has altered their host token making it easier for them to get host in a session.
Modded Health: Players health is above the normal level. (Say the max was 320... they could go past that.)
Player Model Change: The player has changed their in-game character model to something different.
Undead Off The Radar: Player appears dead but can still run around, shoot, kill, drive, etc. These players can not be killed because they are already dead.
