This is a list of players who have been flagged for suspicious activity in the online version of Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA 5 Online). Some of the players on this list have been manually added after they were observed engaging in disruptive behavior, such as killing all other players or causing explosions, which can only be caused by using a mod menu. This list is updated daily. To Rockstar administrators who may view this list, we suggest that you keep a close eye on these players, especially those who have triggered crash detections.
